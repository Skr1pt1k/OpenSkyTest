# This is a test project with a simple Open Sky fetch request.

Using react v. 17.0.1 and redux v 4.0.5

## Available Scripts

To run the project, go to the root folder of the project and run:

### `yarn start:dev`

For login I've used backend which hosted in Heroku written on ruby on rails by myself a year ago (JWT + Cookies), so, the first time when fetch, it may be slow.

Credentials:

### Login: `user@example.com`
### Password: `111111`

Ruby on rails middleware is accepting connections only from fronted with port 8080.
